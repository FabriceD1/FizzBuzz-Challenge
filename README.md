# FizzBuzz-Challenge

The FizzBuzz challenge is a common programming task used to assess the coding abilities of job candidates during interviews. It involves creating a program that outputs a list of numbers from 1 to a given number, with certain numbers replaced by the words "Fizz" and "Buzz". This simple challenge tests the candidate's ability to write code and understand basic programming concepts.

You need to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 such that:

1. If the number is a multiple of 3, you need to print "Fizz" instead of that number.
2. If the number is a multiple of 5, you need to print "Buzz" instead of that number.
3. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, you need to print "FizzBuzz" instead of that number.

Loops and conditional statements is used for the solution.

Program used: Python
